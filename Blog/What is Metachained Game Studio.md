# What is Metachained Game Studio?

Metachained Game Studio is an organization that is researching and developing an intuitive web application framework notably using the Bevy game engine and Django web framework for the development of web-based interactive adventure games powered by Web 3.0 on the ETH 2.0 network.

Hobbyists will be able to easily build their own games and stories without having to install any software on their computer using a web interface system. With some existing knowledge of programming, users will be able to create their own adventure and text based narrative games.

Anyone can play with HTML5 and Javascript compatible devices on the browser.

**Concept Overview**

Text-based adventure games are complex and dynamic narratives that rely on the player's problem solving skills and imagination in order to progress in the story. I think this is an excellent medium for making a game with dynamic characters and storylines.

**Think About It (tai.finance)**

To combine our thinking and develop a platform so we can either observe or reward users for their time and contribution. I thought I would start with these projects that people are motivated by and interested in, within the community. Like, little experiments with D&D inspired narrative games. Similar to the likes of [Gloomhaven](https://cephalofair.com/pages/gloomhaven) or the [Lone Wolf](https://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/Books) text adventure books.

The motivation is that they only need to create a character and they can participate in these experimental projects as they grow, as more content is developed they can continue to explore this narrative. This is akin to the philosophy behind D&D where the imagination and story is the goal.

In my opinion, it shouldn’t take long to build the skills needed to release a game or a project, but because we have this phenomenon known as Intellectual Property (IP) in the creative industries, we are limited in what we can create due to copyright law and require long development times in the games industy. A perspective that I value on this topic has been expressed within my team of developers at [ICPDAO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qajo0YB5S5E).

This is the first step in recognising the problems in trying to move toward our goals within the open source community. I hope we can get a lot of the community involved.

**Building a community around D&D**

-   Create a system for a game based on simple rules.
-   Can be a group of friends that play the game together 3-7 people (one game master).
-   Discover and build a community around the game, immutable content and player generated stories (D&D).

**Rules of the Player Experience**

-   The GM and players shift the traditional orally interactive experience to textual interaction, which can be kept on chain as a permanent gaming record for people to view and get back to for archeological purposes.
-   Admittedly, it does require the gaming participants to act in character for the gaming experience to be fun. But given that all text interactions will be permanently recorded on blockchain, players shall be fairly incentivized to play their characters as well as they can.
-   Dice-rolling events shall be induced by a Game Master (GM) when the GM sees fit. For example, when the textual interaction leads to one player being attacked by some enemy in game, which makes checking against the player's basic attribute(s), like agility, necessary.
-   The GM or Player shall manually trigger the relevant checks against a player's attribute(s) when the GM deems necessary, just like in the traditional board game settings, but by calling on some in-game functions, as opposed to rolling physical dices.
-   When a player is being attacked and a check takes place, that is, a check of an in-game parameter (can be manually input by GM as the GM sees appropriate) against certain player's basic attribute(s), the process shall be carried out automatically by the game’s code. In traditional board games, players roll dice to see what they get out of that roll, then add the random figure to their basic attribute(s), and compare the result to the parameter so that we know whether the player is hit by the attack, or how much damage is done. In short, the code will handle the dice rolling and calculation on behalf of the GM and players.
-   When the calculation is done, player's status like HP shall be updated accordingly. There can be multiple in-game functions the GM can call on to perform such tasks, to take out the manual operations as much as possible.

**Archivist's Curse & Eremidia's 6 Years of Development on RPG Forum**

A lot of Archivist’s character content is a result of years of collaboration between multiple authors.

> "Eremidia" was a collaboration...The effort was meant to group most of the members' unused, abandoned or thrown away characters and concepts that were common in the time the forums existed... The project managed to garner up to 10 individuals, around 80 characters included for the project."

[Eremidia’s Archivist’s Curse](https://richter-h.itch.io/project-chessmaster) is one such example of a project that started many years ago and struggled due to lack of organisation. After many years the separation of the RPG elements and gameplay took place and the game was redesigned from the ground up. Instead of a full story-driven RPG game it became simplified to be like a Chess-spinoff, only with the flavor of a miniaturized chess board with unique characters, abilities and synergies.

The format of a single character is where everything starts. Archivist's Curse has a very flexible: Attack, passive, 3 skills and ultimate.

A character is defined by their looks, their personality, their lore, and sometimes the theme of their mechanics or story. Sure they might look like some other peon or something but they're more than that if you're willing to dig deep enough. Some players will prefer to build their character the way they want to and others might prefer to roleplay a specific character that they own. With a D&D inspired campaign it is much easier to have players create from their own imagination and this will be the initial direction.

**Visual Novels**

Visual novels are narrative driven games with simple mechanics, have many endings and branching storylines. The player is often presented with choices throughout the story that impact the outcome. This makes the experience one to come back to and discover more about each of the characters storylines. The player encounters a combination of choices throughout the game. The result: To reach the true ending. A true ending can be played after completing the other paths that the story allows. Visual novels are usually accompanied by sound and simple graphics which enhance the atmosphere and add to the experience while reading. Achieving what a book is unable to do with just plain text.

Often visual novels have been ridiculed by western cultures, perhaps because of the often sexual content that similar looking games such as dating simulation games usually contain. Which the adventure game genre of visual novels suffers greatly. Often, cultural differences influence our opinion, manga-style was not as popular in the west 8 years ago as it is today. Unfortunately visual novels were never made to appeal to the western market. Although manga has evolved, becoming more westernized, improving over the years. Character design in visual novels continue to be stigmatized in the western market due to the limited budget of this medium.

First impressions are extremely important when trying to communicate anything visually. Projects that are lacking visually impressive art will not get the attention they deserve with just a interesting story. Visual novels suffer for their inability to change and adapt to the global market. They are often criticized for not being games, this is greatly due to the expectation to read a lot of text.

The visual novel medium is one which I deeply admire. It is a medium of games or novels that allow the author to build a meaningful and dynamic experience for the reader. This same philosophy we like to apply in our pursuit for high quality that emphasises strong narrative, rich imagination and opportunistic world building.

My first visual novels that I read were Planetarium, Umineko, Ever17 and Sekien no Inganock just as examples. Each of which was a unique and deeply engaging experience. I have also developed a few short visual novels because I found myself fully immersed in creating a similar experience.

**Aims and Challenges**

First of all when making any kind of game it's important to understand what kind of experience you are trying to communicate and who the target audience is. It is also important to minimize the risk to the project as much as possible and in order to do that we need to recognise the pitfalls and challenges in our design and planning.

There are many pitfalls to making a game and there are even more pitfalls when collaborating with others. It's no longer just you that we are responsible for when making the game. We're responsible for everyone working on the project because the completion of the project depends on everyone’s cooperation and their income. The more people working on a project, the greater the risk. So it's important to understand who you work with, how well you work as a team and how much experience everyone has.

As I began to flesh out the ideas for this project I recognised that the challenges involved in creating this game will be too complex and difficult for me to tackle all at once. There is a lot of work that goes into the game world, characters and gameplay. Games are usually made by a team of qualified people who have a good understanding of the development pipeline.

I want to make games with a meaningful narrative, within a fictional interactive world with visually stunning artwork and characters, to set it apart from existing adventure games and to facilitate an open-ended conversation with players.

Initially the game will be a text-based adventure RPG which will be released for web. It will use a social system and have different progressive storylines. Throughout the game the player will be able to piece together history, culture and fables of the last millennia during the ongoing strife and problems that persists as canonical to the world.

Secondly I want to make a visual novel with beautiful images and animation which is set in the same world as the text-based adventure game to promote high quality graphics and illustration to be used as marketing. This would in-turn be used as the standard for future development and allow users to fully immerse themselves in the gameplay and story when they are playing together.

Phoenix Studio will be made available for hobbyists to make their own adventure games throughout development so everyone can participate equally and promote diversity.

Finally but not lastly I want to make a proof-of-concept that implements an advanced social system and a dynamic narrative system. This is one of the first things that is being worked on to showcase how users will build dynamic and persistent campaigns and stories.

**Metachained Shard Token**

Lastly I'll be releasing $MXCS as an ETH staking token at the value of $12 per token during a 1-year minting period that will promote governance and rewards for contributors. As well as the release of the Phoenix Studio for Open Source development once development and budget targets have been reached.

### Game Design - Shaun Vann’s Grimoire Of The Hunt

**Introduction**

Shaun Vann is a deckbuilding adventure board game set in the unnatural outer worlds known as The Hunt. An obscure dark fantasy introduction to the Metachained role-playing game.

**Concept Pitch**

Be careful, outer-world territories will have many hostiles, and they all have their own means of survival. Quest across the hunt against all manner of mutants and monsters.

Each update brings new monsters, story and characters to the mix. The game has an in-game chat interface to interact with other players, play together in a shared space and join the campaign.

**Marketing**

Developed with the community using **performative development**. This means we will be livestreaming development and engaging with the players throughout the whole development process to improve the game, getting feedback directly from players in our community.

**Features**

-   A grand sense of creativity and discovery.
-   Shared collaborative world.
-   Seasonal events and episodic updates.
-   Rich and detailed history, lore and sinister tales.

"If no provision has been made to save our souls, we are perfectly free to seek salvation any way we can. My way always has been to be as contrary to everything as I can be.—He is the Lord of dark places; for his children gnash their teeth and cry unto Him and are not heard."

— Lord of Dark Places, Hal Bennet

<aside> 🗡️ The world has once more, begun it's fracture. Monsters that kept to their [boundaries] are venturing forth. Travellers and merchants are found dead in the road, towns destroyed. People of the capital are showing signs of unrest. There are whispers that the king is missing and the prince has gone into a frenzy. An adventurer awakens without mind or memory...

### **Game Development**

**Metachained Studio** 
Envisioning an online, digitized version of a tabletop board game, where you sell the players the table they play on and they do what they want using the tools provided.

**Version 1: Phoenix Development**

Phoenix is a powerful source code for making text-based adventure games, utilising the built in dungeon building mechanics, simulated combat system and an advanced social system for building dynamic non-player characters, events, quests and storylines. Gameplay is managed through the command line to be a very traditional adventure game experience.

**Version 2: Appleseed (future development)**

Appleseed uses the many components of the Phoenix core. Making it optimized for a component-based system. It will provide support for actors, backgrounds, animations, sound, a user interface management system, gameplay triggers and extended features of Phoenix.

**Development Time**

2 - 3 months will be spent on the initial testing of the Phoenix release version, while developing the gameplay features of the character builder and campaign node editor. 2 - 3 months will be required for the development of the game and further development before a major release is due.

**Collaborating**

Eventually we'll be looking to work with more people, but as of now this project is for developers at ICPDAO to develop the key skills required for making games in Web 3.0 on Ethereum.

We’d be looking to work with Indie Developers or Game Designers that either have experience in the game design industry or have made their own games and we are understanding that educating and training developers might be necessary to get them up to speed on development or artistic style. Anyone can participate under the assumption that they have become an ICPER on the ICPDAO platform and can receive a fair reward for their contributions. It is an expectation to follow governance and decision making rules that fulfills the core purpose of the development or marketing activities.

**Metachained Podcast**

The podcast should be targeted toward the core and hardcore gamer with the reason to critic the game and shed some light on the fun aspects of gameplay and how it can be improved. Other activities would include voice recordings of our discussions and adventures of Dungeons & Dragons style campaigns hosted on the discord server.
