**Vertical Slice**

Releasing an early demo to play testers is to showcase each of the games core features and aesthetics without the need to release a completed game. The idea is that the game should represent a finished product.

**Weekly Sprints**

Setting effective goals each sprint to allow positive and negative results to form early in the development pipeline. Sometimes tasks can take multiple weeks, in this case we should break up the task into smaller parts with the aim to complete at least one task per day.

**Planning meeting**

This is a session to review the development of the game and share ideas for the following sprint and is usually a longer session. This is a mandatory process as each team member will need to have a clear goal for what they want to achieve that sprint.

**Daily stand up meeting**

The team will meet every day to share what they have done and what they intend to do that day.

**Review**

Every week contributions will be reviewed based on playtesting and feedback. It is important to provide helpful feedback so that the team can make appropriate design choices.

**Playable build**

Every week a build of the game should be created and tested either on the last day of the week by the developers. Or every 2 weeks whenever there is a major update. This build of the game should be a vertical slice so that planning and related feedback can be actionable in the following sprint.

**Public Testing**

To maintain transparency and engagement with participants, a vertical slice should be released every 2 to 4 weeks. A playable version should be made available to the team every week.

**Pre-Production**

The early phase of development is a very creative process and it includes building tools or artistic concepts that will help speed up development later in development. It is worth mentioning that all suggested ideas, concepts and development will count towards their contributions. 

**Production**

At this stage of development the design should be clear and the team will have decided to make cuts in the pre-production stage.

**Post-Production**

This will usually focus on quality of life changes, fixing bugs, implementing sound and improving the feel of the game before an upcoming deadline. It is important to pay attention to the things that are working and the things that arenâ€™t as some cuts will still need to be made. 

Marketing material and press release will also need to be prepared ahead of schedule to ensure the game is ready for release.Vertical Slice
